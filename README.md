### The Story behind this project

I am Lisa aka Lilou, a junior frontend developper, it's nice to meet you!

September 2022 started a new chapter of my life: I decided to embark on a new path and become a frontend developer.
To set this in motion, I applied at Becode in LiÃ¨ge and was luckily accepted for an intensive training as a junior web developer.

âœ¨ **The new adventure could and should begin.** âœ¨

A lot has happened in these 7 months, I had the opportunity to learn a lot and to program even more.

And at this point in my training, which is slowly coming to an end, I would like to share with you what I have done so far.

Take a look at my projects and my story.
Have fun reading, scrolling and discovering!
